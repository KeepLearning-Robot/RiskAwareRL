Contains code for Risk-Aware Bayesian Reinforcement Learning for Cautious Exploration

Experiments for each of the two scenarios (Bridge and Pacman) can be done by running the 'main.py' file found within each folder, with an integer as command-line input. This integer is the experiment number, used for keeping track of multiple experiments. Results will be generated and stored in the relevant 'Results' folder.

[Alternatively, if you have a conda environment called 'minimal_ds' with the relevant packages, you can use the 'run_experiments.sh' shell script found within each folder.]
